Rarity Mod – Rare & Fabled Loot

Adds a lightweight rarity system to Erenshor-style loot. When enemies drop equippables (weapons/armor), each item rolls a rarity: Common, Rare, or Fabled (configurable rates; default ~94% / 5.5% / 0.5%). Rare/Fabled items are automatically scaled—Rare = 1.3× stats, Fabled = 2× stats—and renamed using clean prefixes (e.g., “Fabled Blightsteel Greaves”). Drop % is adjustable in BepInEx Config manager, but is advised to leave as default to ensure character progression is not largely affected early on with OP gear.
